# Show latest email on top in New Outlook
As we move away from Classic Outlook to New Outlook, one noticable change that I've seen is that the latest email in a grouped conversation is listed at the bottom. One can easily get confused and reply to an older message. 

## Can we change this behaviour?
Good news is that, this behaviour can be changed.
1. From the ribbon on the top, go to View Settings.

3. In the settings window, click email on left hand side panel, then choose Layout.
4. Under the Reading pane section, there's a setting that allows to show the latest email on the top of the grouped conversation.
